After connecting your wallet, your profile page will allow you to see your total ETH and PAL tokens. Additionally, we added a C/P button that will allow you to quickly utilize your wallet address from our app.

**Figure C:**  On this screen, you will be able to see your pigskin pals and scroll through them. They will updated automatically as they will always directly reflect the contents of your wallet.

**Figure D:** On this screen, you will be able to see the averages for your pigs. They will automatically sort alphabetically by team and position order (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, D/ST). This is the MVP season 1 mockup, but we plan on releasing more fantasy analytics tied to your NFTs.
