# üê∑ Season One: The Oinks

In Season One, we follow the first group to enter the atmosphere of Planet Football: the Oinks. Don‚Äôt let their cute and cuddly appearances fool you. They can pack a punch and are known for their prowess on the defensive side of the football. Their signature move, the Pork Chop, can tear through an O-Line like a hot knife through butter. They come from their home planet, the Muddership, a warm tropical planet in the heart of the Swine Nebula.

In the year 2022, a battalion of 9,600 of the toughest Oinks set out on a mission to the Arachne Galaxy in order to sign a pivotal peace treaty between their race and the Arachnids, a species of spider-like humanoids. Ever since Charlotte the Arachnid‚Äôs Queen Mother died, multiple rebellious factions hungry for power launched attacks on neighboring systems including the home planet of the Oinks. The Oinks‚Äô battalion was charged with delivering a peace offering of gold to one of the rebel factions on an outskirt planet in the Arachne galaxy where the rebel Arachnid base was located. During the journey, their ship‚Äôs geolocator was damaged and their ship fell short of the hyperspace travel requirements to arrive safely in the Arachne galaxy and instead fell into a time/space limbo. Their ship tumbled through this limbo for what felt like minutes and crash landed on a previously civilized but seemingly abandoned planet. Planet Football.
