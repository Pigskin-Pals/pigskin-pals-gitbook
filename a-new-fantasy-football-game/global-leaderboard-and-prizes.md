![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

On the leaderboard page, the top 50 NFTs for each position by score will be showcased live throughout the week with updating scores every couple of minutes! Change your push notifications to your liking to get custom alerts on when your pigs are in the Top 50 or even the Top 5.

Each week the top five pigs of each position will receive a monetary prize. Our operating prize pool for the 2022-2023 football season will be based on the successful mint of our project. These are our projected prize pools based on % sold:

**25% of NFTs sold: $50,000**

**50% of NFTs sold: $100,000**

**75% of NFTs sold: $200,000**

**100% of NFTs sold: $400,000**

Our mission is to give a significant portion of the mint revenue back to the community!
